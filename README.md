# My dotfiles and configurations for reproducable NixOS setup.

This can be used as a base to create my user-friendly and familiar setup in any PC/Laptop very quickly, just copy and run! Thats all.

## What are the packages are being used?

- NixOS Flakes (**Currently Experimental**)
- Home-Manager

## Where the home-manager files are?

You can find the home manager files under, `/home` and `.nix` files will be under the `/home/modules` folder. Regular dotfiles are in `/home/dotfiles` folder.

## Flakes

Flakes are being used in this configuration, you can find all the flake configurations under `/modules` folder. As the name suggest, the flakes configuration has been broken down into many seperate files to keep the project managable and maintainable

### I really hope this will help someone in the future, Good Luck!, feel free to commit!.
